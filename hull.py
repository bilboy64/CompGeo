# NOTES: 
# 1. The following program calculates convex hull of a randomly generated set (list) of elements of R^2 (and R^3).
# Every algorithm is defined as a function for organization purposes. 

# 2. According to the algorithm the user desires, the program calculates and prints the convex hull's vertices as its
# output. After every convex hull computation, we allow the user to re-enter an algorithm name of his choosing, if he 
# wants to test the correctness of each output. 

# 3. Terminate the program by either typing in "No" when asked if you want to continue, or by simply hitting ctrl + C.
